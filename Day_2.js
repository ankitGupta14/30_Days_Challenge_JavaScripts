// Day 2: Operators

// Activity 1: Arithmetic Operations

// Task 1: Write a program to add two numbers and log the result to the console

const chai = 8;
const Code = 4;
console.log("Task 1 =", 8 + 4);

// Task 2: Write a program to subtract two numbers and log the result to the console.
const code = 8;
const mail = 4;
console.log("Task 2 =", 8 - 4);

// Task 3: Write a program to multiply two numbers and log the result to the console.
const black = 4;
const white = 3;
console.log("Task 3 =", 4 * 3);

// Task 4: Write a program to divide two numbers and log the result to the console.
const red = 4;
const blue = 2;
console.log("Task 4 =", 4 / 2);

// Task 5: Write a program to find the remainder when one number is divided by another and log the result to the console.
const green = 4;
const yellow = 2;
console.log("Task 5 =", 4 % 2);

// Activity 2: Assignment Operators

// Task 6: Use the += operator to add a number to a variable and log the result to the console.
let number = 5;
let addNumber = 9;
number += addNumber;
console.log("Task 6 =", number);

// Task 7: Use the -= operator to subtract a number from a variable and log the result to the console.
let largeNO = 7;
let smallNo = 3;
largeNO -= smallNo;
console.log("Task 7 =", largeNO);

// Activity 3: Comparison Operators

// Task 8: Write a program to compare two numbers using > and < and log the result to the console.
let no = 94;
let so = 99;
console.log("Task 8 =", no > so, no < so);

// Task 9: Write a program to compare two numbers using >= and <= and log the result to the console.
let no1 = 94;
let so1 = 99;
console.log("Task 9 =", no1 >= so1, no1 <= so1);
// Task 10: Write a program to compare two numbers using == and === and log the result to the console.
let no2 = 94;
let so2 = 99;
console.log("Task 10 =", no2 == so2, no2 === so2);

// Activity 4: Logical Operators

// Task 11: Write a program that uses the && operator to combine two conditions and log the result to the console.
let no3 = 94;
let so3 = 99;
console.log("Task 11 =", no3 > so3 && no3 < so3);

// Task 12: Write a program that uses the || operator to combine two conditions and log the result to the console.
let no4 = 94;
let so4 = 99;
console.log("Task 12 =", no4 > so4 || no4 < so4);

// Task 13: Write a program that uses the ! operator to negate a condition and log the result to the console.
let no5 = 94;
console.log("Task 13 =", !no5);

// Activity 5: Ternary Operator

// Task 14: Write a program that uses the ternary operator to check if a number is positive or negative and log the result to the console.

let task14 = -5;

let result = number >= 0 ? "positive" : "negative";

console.log("Task 14 =", result);
